Trepidation
: a nervous or fearful feeling of uncertain agitation

Watching as your children grow is such an amazing experience. Today I watched my little one as she was leaving our row in church to go sing with the Primary. I asked her _are you ready to go?_ She practically jumped off of her chair. _Yes!_  she shouted—her eyes full of excitement and pride. I told her _it’s time to go._ She took a few steps, then stopped and turned around. Nervously she said _okay. Bye!_ Then stood still. Not wanting to seem too much like little child—but not sure of going it alone. My heart jumped. I want to say _It’s okay to feel a little trepidation!_ and knowing that these moments will happen less and less often, I jump out of my seat and hold her little hand. We walk together to the front of the chapel. She joins her friends and sings the song.
