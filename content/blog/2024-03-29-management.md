> The difference between a manager and a leader is their focus. A manager focuses on inputs. A leader focuses on outputs.

## Behind the Desk

It has been an interesting week at work. Annual evaluations were due. We also had the State _Mechanic of the Year_ competition. My best employee _and_ my worst employee both decided to resign.

That was unexpected.

I take my new role pretty seriously. I try to be the best _leader_ that I can be. I probably have more failures than I realize because I don't hear all of the scuffle. My goal is to be that supervisor that can lead people through the tough times. When more than one person hands me their resignation, I can't help but look in the mirror to see what I need to change.
