## More 11ty fun!
- [X] Replace home page with latest blog post.
- [X] Fix web fonts (actually link the stylesheets inside the <head> of the index)

I feel so much better now to get those checked off the list! ***Whew!***

## Worky Work
One thing that I have noticed about myself is that at the end of the work-day I am not great at writing. I should do this more in the morning.

Time for some more coffee ☕️.
