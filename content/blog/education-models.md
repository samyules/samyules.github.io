## Cognitive Apprenticeship
### Apprenticeship Education Model
During this phase of education the focus is on doing real-world tasks. *Modeling* is provided by competent and expert workers as they complete the tasks. This allows the learner to build a conceptual knowledge of the whole picture. They should be able to see and conceptualize the big-picture of the task. After viewing the model the learner is provided with *scaffolding* - simplified versions of the task - to build specific skills required for the task, and to build their confidence. Through this process the learner develops self-monitoring and correction skills. They become more independent in the task until the scaffolding is *faded* away.

This process is repeated for various skills until the learner reaches the level of Journeyman. At this point they posess the skills to work independently, but they may still lack a solid understanding of the underlying concepts. For a mechanic, this may mean that with the help of a manual they can troubleshoot and repair a machine, but still not have a full understanding the internal functioning of the machine or the scientic principles that drive it. This is not the end of their journey.
