It uses 4G LTE and 5G cellular networks to provide internet connectivity. They provide you with a cellular modem/router with a wifi hotspot and a couple of ethernet ports. I figured out how to disable the wifi and connected it to the WAN port of my UDM Pro. Easy-peasy.</p>\n<p>There are some trade offs. There is some variability in the signal quality, which translates to extra latency some of the time. The cellular networks also use CG-NAT and <strong>T-mobile does not provide a public IP address.</strong></p>\n<p>I could get around this by setting up some <em>Cloudflare tunnels</em>. They are easy and work great. The main problem is that I want to control my own SSL certificates. Cloudflare creates a wildcard certificate for subdomains (*.mydomain.io), but only root level subdomains. Inside my LAN I use sub-subdomains. For example, <em>service.computername</em>.mydomain.io. For publicly exposed services I prefer using the same URL inside my LAN and over WAN, and Cloudflare tunnels are not able to give me that.</p>\n<p>My LAN is now diving beneath the depths CG-NAT. I need a snorkel.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-txt\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-txt\">    public ip (vps)\n\n     |  s  |\n/\\/\\/|  n  |\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\n     |  o  |  Deep Waters of CG-NAT\n     |  r  |\n     |  k  |\n     |  e  |\n     |  l  |\n     \\     \\________\n      \\  tailscale --> DMZ --> LAN\n       \\____________\n</code></pre>\n<p>So basically, Iâ€™ve got a VPS with a public IP. It connects to my DMZ proxy server through my Tailscale tailnet. The VPS forwards any traffic it receives on ports 80 and 443 to the proxy server. <strong>Â¡Viola! A snorkel!</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"forwarding-packets\" tabindex=\"-1\">Forwarding Packets <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://example.com/blog/2024-02-25-snorkeling/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>My initial thought was to turn my VPS into a router. I tried using iptables to forward ports, but Iâ€™m not very good at writing rules and had a few problems. I couldnâ€™t figure out how to forward packets through tailscale. ðŸ¤” After some more searching around the interwebs I found an old program called <em><a href=\"https://github.com/samhocevar/rinetd\">rinetd</a></em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rinetd-setup\" tabindex=\"-1\">rinetd setup <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://example.com/blog/2024-02-25-snorkeling/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><em>rinetd</em> silently forwards tcp and udp traffic. It is found in most linux package managers. Iâ€™m using an Ubuntu server, so I installed it with an easy <code>sudo apt install rinetd</code>. The configuration file is found in <code>/etc/rinetd.conf</code>. The main section looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token comment\"># bindaddress bindport connectaddress connectport</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">137.184</span>.89.83 <span class=\"token number\">80</span> <span class=\"token number\">100.86</span>.67.77 <span class=\"token number\">80</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">137.184</span>.89.83 <span class=\"token number\">443</span> <span class=\"token number\">100.86</span>.67.77 <span class=\"token number\">443</span></code></pre>\n<p>The <code>bindaddress</code> is the public ip of the VPS, and the <code>connectaddress</code> is the tailnet address of the proxy server. Easy. After updating the configuration, run a quick <code>systemctl start rinetd</code> and you are set. No need to mess with forwarding rules. It just works.</p>\n<p>Time to make more coffee.</p>\n",

I have been an Xfinity customer for more than a decade. In my area, it has really been the <em>only</em> option for high-speed internet connections. I have always felt uneasy about the leverage that Xfinity has had over the market. I hate the equipment fees, and the lack of good customer service. I refused to use an Xfinity router or modem, instead opting to buy my own.</p>\n<p>A few years ago they implemented a data cap, and I â€” untrusting of the monopoly-induced power of the company â€” purchased a UDM Pro SE and started measuring my own data usage. Throughout these years the usage reported by Xfinity was typically higher than my own measurements, but within a reasonable margin of error. However, that changed in December of 2023. During that month the UDM Pro measured about 800GB of throughput, and Xfinity reported a whopping <strong>2400GB</strong> of usage! <strong>Three times more</strong>!</p>\n<p>I walked in to the nearest Xfinity store intending to ask for a service ticket. <s>However, I was told in no uncertain terms that <em><strong>the Lord God of Xfinity</strong></em> in it's <em><strong>mighty Glory</strong></em> and <em><strong>omnicient knowing</strong></em> is the <em>only</em> source of <strong>truth</strong>. My own paltry attempt at measuring throughput was meaningless. <em>Xfinity's</em> mighty judgement would not be questioned! How dare I question it?</s> <em>Okay, okay... those were not their exact words, but they are not <strong>that</strong> hyperbolic either.</em> They refused to submit a service ticket on my behalf, and told me to quietly pay the bill of over $300, <s>and that I should leave with a <em>smile</em> on my face</s>.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead I left with a solid resolve to cancel my account.</strong> I saw the commercials for T-Mobile Home Internet, advertised for $50 a month with <em>unlimited</em> data usage. It actually ended up being slightly cheaper than that since I am an existing T-mobile customer. It offers better speeds than any other ISP in my area besides Xfinity, and I am happy with my choice (so far). A week or so later I closed my Xfinity account and I am not looking back.</p>\n<p>T-mobile home internet brings some additional challenges. Namely, I am now sitting behind a messy CG-NAT. I do not have a public IP address to access my home network. If you google around a bit, most people solve this by using a <em>Cloudflare</em> tunnel. I have used them before, and it is an easy and effective solution, even providing ssl certificates automatically. But, <em>I</em> prefer doing things the <em>hard</em> way. It's the only way to learn something new.</p>\n<p>This post is getting quite long. Now that you know the backstory, I will post the <em>exciting</em> details of my own personal solution to these problems.</p>\n<p>Time to make more coffee.</p>\n",
